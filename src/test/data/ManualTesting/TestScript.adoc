== Setting up

=== Downloading the app
.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `AB&B.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for AB&B.
*Important*: Ensure that you have full read/write access to that folder to ensure optimum performance of AB&B.

=== Loading sample data
. Create a new folder, named `data`, at the root folder of AB&B.
. Copy `SampleData.xml` into the `data` folder and *rename* it to `addressbook.xml`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Testing

=== Zechariah add your add function with NOK here, and also the find function.

=== Wang Jie add your functions, filter and add/remove tag, alongside the edit command.

=== Deletion

==== Delete by Index - `delete INDEX`
Deletes the person in AB&B at the specified `INDEX` according to the currently displayed person list.

===== Test commands
. `delete 1`
. Verify that the person at the first index is deleted.
. You may vary the `INDEX` of the person to delete and verify that the corresponding person is deleted accordingly.
. You may proceed to test the delete function with any filtered list using the `find` command.

==== Delete by Name - `deletebyname NAME`
Deletes the person in AB&B with the specified `NAME`. `NAME` comparisons are case-insensitive, but require an exact match.
*Important*: Does not depend on the current person list being displayed.

===== Test commands
The following commands are to add independent test data to demonstrate the `deletebyname` command.

. `add n/Russell Ferguson p/12345678 e/russellferguson@example.com a/Littlest Pet Shop t/BestPet`
. `add n/Russell Lee p/34142451 e/russelllee@example.com a/1 Computing Drive`
. `add n/Alex Russell p/94537432 e/alexrussell@example.com a/1 Engineering Drive`
. `add n/Biskit p/83457374 e/brittanybiskit@example.com a/Largest Ever Pet Shop`
. `add n/Biskit p/83457473 e/whittanybiskit@example.com a/Largest Ever Pet Shop`

The next few commands are to test the behaviour of `deletebyname` command.

. `deletebyname russell lee`
. Verify that Russell Lee has been deleted.
. `deletebyname russell`
. Verify that the displayed person list shows suggestions of possible persons to delete as an exact match
cannot be found.

. `find biskit`
. `deletebyname alex russell`
. Verify that Alex Russell has been deleted. (You may use the `find` or `list` command) This demonstrates how
it is independent of the displayed person list.

. `list` (This is to reset the displayed person list.)
. `deletebyname bisKIT`
. This demonstrates the case-insensitivity of the `deletebyname` command and how it will update the displayed persons
list to show all matching persons. Deletion will then have to be done using the `delete` command.

=== Sort persons by name - `sort`
Sorts all persons in the address book by name in alphabetical order.

==== Test commands
. `sort`
. Verify that the contact list on the left is sorted by name in alphabetical order.
. Proceed to modify the existing contacts list by adding a new person or editing a current person's name such that it is no longer in alphabetical order.
. `sort`
. Verify that the contact list is sorted in alphabetical order once again.

=== Google Maps search by address
Selecting a person's card on the contact list panel will have his / her address location displayed on Google Maps in the browser panel on the right hand side.

==== Test commands
*Important*: Mac users will face a bug such that invalid characters will be displayed instead of the person's address in the Google Maps search interface due to font incompatibility.

. Add a new person with a valid address. If you want the Google Maps search result location to be accurate, make sure you key in an address that exists in reality.
. Click on the person card that you have just added into the contact list.
. Verify that the person's address location is shown on Google Maps in the browser panel.

=== Selecting a theme - `theme INDEX`
Switches current theme to the one given by a specific `INDEX`. There are 4 available themes: Midnight, Summer, Coffee, Crayon. The default theme is the Midnight Theme. You may refer to our user guide for screenshots of the themes to see how they should look like.

==== Test commands
. `theme 2`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Summer Theme.
. `theme 3`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Coffee Theme.
. `theme 4`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Crayon Theme.
. `theme 1`
. Verify that the theme is switched to the Midnight Theme.

=== Exporting data to CSV - `export`
Exports the current data in AB&B to a CSV file in the same folder as the AB&B executable. The file will be named
`AddressBookData.csv`.

==== Test commands
*Important*: Export function may encounter errors if the appropriate read/write permissions are not granted to AB&B.

. `export`
. Verify that the CSV file exists and that the data is correct. *Important*: Commas present in addresses will be
replaced with a semi-colon (;). This is to preserve the structure of the CSV file.

. Proceed to make any change to the existing data. (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, etc).
. `export`
. Verify that the CSV file is updated with any change(s) made.

. `clear`
. `export`
. The export command should fail as it will not allow empty data to be exported.
